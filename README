The RltvNmbr plugin uses the signs feature to display the line numbering relative to the current line.  A number of commands take [count] arguments for which this is helpful.

:RltvNmbr
    This command turns relative line numbering on.

:RltvNmbr!
    This command turns relative line numbering off.

CAVEAT:
    Your vim must have the signs feature compiled in!  This typically means that your vim has been configured and compiled to be "huge":
        configure --with-features=huge
        compile
        install

	To check this:
		:echo has("signs")
	should show a "1".  Alternatively, look at the output of  :version  and see if you have +signs listed.
